# Machine Learning: Rock Paper Scissor Classifier

_This work is a personal assignment for Dicoding as a part of the Digital Talent Scholarship._

<img src="gallery/janken.jpg" align="left" width="110" height="110"> In this project, I use Python programming to build a CNN machine learning model. This model then is used to classify rock/paper/scissor hand-sign from provided image. This model is built using 2188 samples divided into 3 categories (rock, paper, and scissor). This model achieved more than 96% accuracy. Please access the python notebook **[here](dicoding_rps_fl.ipynb)** for detail of the result.
